# Discrete_Choice_Modelling_Using_MNL

ABSTRACT  
This project focuses on discrete choice modelling using the Swissmetro dataset with 
Biogeme and extends to an itinerary choice dataset using the Larch library. The primary 
objective is to several factors on travel mode choices. The methodology involves 
understand and predict travellers’ mode choices based on various attributes such as 
time periods, carriers, equipment types, fares, elapsed times, and the number of 
connections for itinerary choice model and travel time, cost, and alternative availability 
for Swissmetro Model. The model is specified, estimated, and compared to understand 
the influence of key steps such as data loading and pre-processing, model specification, 
model building and estimation, and evaluation and prediction. The model’s performance 
is evaluated, and predictions are made to assess its accuracy. 
In parallel, the itinerary choice dataset is utilized to build and estimate an MNL model 
using Larch. This involves defining a utility function with variables influencing itinerary 
choices, constructing the model, and estimating its parameters by maximizing the log 
likelihood function. The findings from both datasets highlight significant variables 
affecting mode and itinerary choices, demonstrating the application of advanced choice 
modelling techniques using Biogeme and Larch. This project provides valuable insights 
for transportation planners and policymakers, helping to enhance travel demand models 
and improve transportation services.
